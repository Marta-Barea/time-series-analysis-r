## **Contents**
The repository includes:

1. **Introduction to Time Series:**
   - Basic concepts: seasonality, trends, noise.
   - Data exploration and visualization.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaning and transformation methods.
   - Handling missing data.
   - Time series decomposition.

3. **Time Series Models:**
   - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average).
   - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA).
   - Exponential Smoothing models.
   - Machine Learning-based methods (optional).

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Performance metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.
   - Cross-validation for time series.

5. **Practical Examples:**
   - Financial data forecasting.
   - Sales time series analysis.
   - Real-world case studies.
